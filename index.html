                    Urbanization is the process by which rural areas transform into urban areas as cities grow and
                    expand.
                    It occurs due to various factors such as population growth, migration from rural to urban areas, and
                    industrialization. As more people move to cities in search of better opportunities, the urban
                    landscape
                    undergoes significant changes. This phenomenon is not limited to a particular region or country but
                    is a
                    global trend.

                    <h2>Effects of Urbanization</h2>
                    <p>Urbanization has profound effects on the environment, society, and economy. Some of the key
                        environmental
                        changes caused by urbanization include:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Loss of Natural Habitat: As cities expand, natural habitats such as forests, wetlands, and
                            grasslands are often cleared to make way for buildings, roads, and other infrastructure.
                        </li>
                        <li>Air and Water Pollution: Increased industrial activity, vehicle emissions, and improper
                            waste
                            disposal contribute to air and water pollution in urban areas, affecting human health and
                            ecosystem
                            integrity.</li>
                        <li>Heat Island Effect: Urban areas experience higher temperatures compared to surrounding rural
                            areas
                            due to the concentration of buildings and paved surfaces, leading to the urban heat island
                            effect.
                        </li>
                        <li>Disruption of Ecosystems: Urbanization fragments and disrupts ecosystems, leading to loss of
                            biodiversity and ecological imbalance.</li>
                        <li>Resource Depletion: Urban areas consume large amounts of resources such as water, energy,
                            and raw
                            materials, putting pressure on natural systems and contributing to resource depletion.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Urban Planning: Implementing sustainable urban planning practices, such as mixed land-use
                            development, green spaces, and efficient transportation systems, can help reduce
                            environmental
                            impacts.</li>
                        <li>Green Infrastructure: Incorporating green infrastructure, such as parks, green roofs, and
                            permeable
                            surfaces, can mitigate the urban heat island effect, improve air quality, and enhance
                            biodiversity.
                        </li>
                        <li>Renewable Energy: Promoting the use of renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind
                            power, can
                            reduce greenhouse gas emissions and dependence on fossil fuels.</li>
                        <li>Waste Management: Implementing effective waste management strategies, including recycling,
                            composting, and proper disposal, can minimize pollution and resource depletion.</li>
                        <li>Public Awareness: Educating the public about the importance of sustainable living practices
                            and
                            encouraging community involvement in environmental conservation efforts can foster a culture
                            of
                            environmental stewardship.</li>
